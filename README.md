# JSTipCalculator

This is a program that calculates the tip amount. It's my first time writing a complete JS program. I got the idea from https://skillcrush.com/blog/projects-you-can-do-with-javascript/ when I was looking for some projects to practice.

There are three files:
 - index.html: all of the html and the form
 - styles.css: the styling for the page
 - script.js: takes in the inputs from the form and returns the tip amount
 
 The program takes in:
 - The bill amount
 - The service quality
 - The number of people you were dining with 
 
 and returns a tip amount. It's pretty simple; I'm hoping to write some more complex JS programs in the future!
